# Project template starter
Template to use in any language

## Best practices 
This is an effort to list the different best practices to create a project from scratch in any language but not aimed to an specific OS or IDE.

### Baseline template
This should serve as a project to be used as a template to language specific templates like:
- NodeJs
- Ruby
- Python
- PHP

#### Git ignore file

This file will simply let you ignore folders, OS specific files and language specific folders, files, etc. It will be also important to note that any IDE folder or files should be also included, ideally a project should not be IDE dependent.

### Containers
Usage of containers to test different approaches, editors and even OSes to help ease the environment related configurations.
